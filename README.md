# TypeScript Type Error
This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript and its solution.

## Description
The `greeter` function expects a string argument, but the `user` variable is an array. This mismatch causes a type error.

## Solution
The solution modifies the `greeter` function to accept an array of strings or changes how `user` is handled to provide only one string.
